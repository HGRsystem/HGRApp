#  Hand Gestures Recognition using ML

A real time video is analyzed for hand recognition and then trained for gesture recognition made through hands. The live video is record through mobile camera. It uses machine learning techniques to train and predict the hand gestures. Python will be the dominant programming language used along with Java for deployment of the model. This will be deployed in Android phones.

# Steps
The initial step is to record video from camera in certain frame rates suitable. The images fetched from video will go through a series of pre-processing such as grey scale image conversion, image correction and binary image conversion. This data will be used to recognize hand, then motion and gesture detection in the image using various datasets. After detection, gestures will convert into text and speech information for communication.
